# Nix Config

Arch broke my bootloader. Guess it's time to switch to NixOS.

## Hosts

Laptop: for work.
Desktop: for music production & gaming.

## Modules

### Desktop Environments

KDE Plasma 6.

### Neovim

Configured with [NixVim](https://github.com/nix-community/nixvim).
I have spent way too long messing with Neovim and NixVim.
