  # https://github.com/jtroo/kanata
  # communicates directly with the system kernel
  # so it is independent of windowing systems
  # meaning it works in X11, Wayland and Virtual Terminals
  # also works across Linux, macOS and Windows
  #
  # to force exit kanata, press and hold `Left Control + Space + Escape`
  # works on the key input before any remappings done by kanata

  # enables `uinput` kernel module, which allows emulating input devices from userspace

  # https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/c3aa7b8938b17aebd2deecf7be0636000d62a2b9/nixos/modules/services/hardware/kanata.nix#L112
  # creates a systemd service for each keyboard, named `kanata-${keyboard-name}.service`
  # creates a DynamicUser for each keyboard, named `kanata-${keyboard-name}`
  # `SupplementaryGroups=input,uinput` so DynamicUser can read physical inputs and send emulated inputs
  # `RuntimeDirectory=kanata-${keyboard-name}` to create temp dir `kanata-${keyboard-name}` in `/run/`
  # dir `/run/kanata-${keyboard-name}` owned by DynamicUser, created when service is started, removed when service is stopped
 
  ### About systemd
  #
  # https://0pointer.net/blog/dynamic-users-with-systemd.html
  # https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.exec.html#DynamicUser=
  # `DynamicUser=`
  # Takes a boolean parameter.
  # If set, a UNIX user and group pair is allocated dynamically when the unit is started, and released as soon as it is stopped.
  # The user and group will not be added to `/etc/passwd` or `/etc/group`, but are managed transiently during runtime.
  # Do not leave files or directories owned by these users/groups around, as a different unit might get the same UID/GID assigned later on, and thus gain access to these files or directories.
  # Use `RuntimeDirectory=` in order to assign a writable runtime directory to a service, owned by the dynamic user/group and removed automatically when the unit is terminated.
  # Use `StateDirectory=`, `CacheDirectory=` and `LogsDirectory=` in order to assign a set of writable directories for specific purposes to the service in a way that they are protected from vulnerabilities due to UID reuse.
  
  ### About Virtual Terminals
  #
  # `TTY` is short for TeleTYpewriter
  # it is possible to have multiple independent user sessions by using multiple ttys
  #
  # switch ttys with `Ctrl + Alt + F{1-...}`
  # list all ttys with `ls -l /dev/tty*`: tty, tty0-63, ttyS0-S3 (serial)
  #
  # currently it works like this on NixOS (but these are not hard rules):
  # - `/dev/tty` represents the terminal for the current process
  # - tty1-tty6 run login session services
  # - display manager (SDDM) starts in tty7
  # - display manager login spawns desktop environment (Plasma) in tty8
